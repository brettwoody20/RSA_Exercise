#Could implement RSA class here

    #static list of primes
    #e is considered static
    
    #constructor generates p, q, N (private variables)
    
    #function to get public key N, e
    
    #function to encrypt a message using RSA (int m, string plaintext) -> (int c, string encrypted)
    
    #function to decrypt a message using RSA (int c, string encrypted) -> (string plaintext)
    
#NOTE: if RSA would be a class stored on a server, then they would not store the p, q values- those would be stored on the client's side
