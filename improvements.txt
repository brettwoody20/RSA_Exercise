- break down functionality
- turn RSA into a class that you can message
    - could also implement a server of users with RSA keys
    - make primes static (chosen upon instantiation and then kept)
- make files that are stored
    - encrypted messages can be stored and then selected to be decrypted
    - would involve putting RSA key at top of the message and store decryption variable
